XMIT is an efficient session protocol that is used with
network protocols such as UDP and TCP or with inter-process
communications.  XMIT provides reliable application messaging
using lightweight logical sessions. XMIT supports asynchronous
peer to peer and one to many communications, allowing other
patterns to be synthesized.

This is a Java implementation of the XMIT protocol by Pantor
Engineering AB (http://www.pantor.com).
The XMIT specification can be found at http://blinkprotocol.org.
